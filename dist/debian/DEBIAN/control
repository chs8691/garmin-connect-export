Description: Download a copy of your Garmin Connect data, including stats and GPX tracks.
 This script will backup your personal Garmin Connect data. All downloaded data will go into a directory called YYYY-MM-DD_garmin_connect_export/ in the current working directory. Activity records and details will go into a CSV file called activities.csv. GPX files (or whatever format you specify) containing track data, activity title, and activity descriptions are saved as well, using the Activity ID.
